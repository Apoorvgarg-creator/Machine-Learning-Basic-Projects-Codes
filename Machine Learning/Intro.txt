Machine learning pipeline
    * Data Generation / collection / Web scrapping
    * Data clearing / Feature Engineering
    *Algorithms to find interesting patterns
    * Deployment
--> Data can be generated from sklearn

--> feature engineering --> features on which our algo will depend
--> deep learning includes image, speech and text
Machine learning are broadly divided into two category -
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised learning
also --> 3. semi supervised learning
         4. reinforcement learning


********** Supervised Learning ***********
--> learn from past data (labelled)
--> generalize prediction on the future data and avoid "OVERFITTING"

--> self notes


******* Machine Learning algo ***********
1. KNN (k - nearest neighbour)
--> helps in classification and Regression
--> supervised learning algorithm
