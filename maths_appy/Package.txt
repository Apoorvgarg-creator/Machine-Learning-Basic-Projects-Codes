What is a package?
package is a collection of modules
To show that a directory is a package they must have __init__.py file
for example --> math is a package that contains different type of modules

What is a module?
module is a python file that have different functions and behavior


when we import a package, we are basically importing the __init__.py

What is the main use of  __init__.py ?
by using the __all__ we can import the modules of the package

what if there is a simple print statement in a python file that you imported
so if you run the the python file , the import file data gets all executed
To avoid that , we can do -->
We have a special variable called __name__
so add the statement
if __name__ == '__main__':
   print(hello)
